A JavaScript implementation of an Earley parser
===============================================

This is a straightforward implementation of an Earley parser
[as explained in this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earley_parser).

The intent of this project is not to provide a fully usable parsing library.
The author develops this parser for his personal enlightenment.
He shares the source code in the hope that others can learn from it or give useful feedback.
